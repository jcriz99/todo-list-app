# To-Do List App

A clean and simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. Your tasks are saved in your browserâ€™s `localStorage` so they persist between visits.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly enter a new task and add it to the list.
- **Complete Tasks:** Click a task to mark it as complete or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved using `localStorage`, so they'll still be there next time you open the app.
